description: Verify theprototype.app changes end-to-end with Playwright — the committed tests/e2e suite, single-page and two-peer (PeerJS cloud) recipes, the debugStores hook, and known flakes. Use before committing any feature.

# E2E verification recipe for theprototype.app

## The committed suite (start here)

`tests/e2e/*.test.cjs` + `helpers.cjs` (`.cjs` — the package is `"type": "module"`).
Run with the dev server up (`npm run dev`, https on 5173):

```
npm run e2e                      # all suites, sequential (~25 min)
npm run e2e -- ping drawing      # subset by name (normal during development)
```

**Every feature phase adds a suite here** (not in scratchpad) and updates any suite its
UI changes break — in the same commit. helpers.cjs exports: `launch(options)` (pass
`{args:[...]}` for fake media), `setupPage(browser, name)` (init script + hydration +
peer id), `connect(from, to, settleMs=9000)`, `check(ok, label)`,
`eventually(fn, predicate, label, timeout)`, `projectPoint(page, [x,y,z])` (world →
screen pixel for real clicks), `finish(browser)` (exit code), `run(body)`.

Rules: never run suites in parallel (shared dev server), never edit sources while one
runs (HMR reloads the pages mid-test).

## The debugStores hook — the ONLY sanctioned test API

The init script (helpers does it) sets `localStorage.debugStores='true'` +
`hasSeenDisclaimer='true'`. App.svelte then publishes `window.__stores` = all stores
spread + modules: `meshEdit, vrControls, autosave, voiceChat, annotationsHandler,
flowRuntime, history, materialsHandler, objectActions, commandsHandler, moduleSDK,
drawMode, pathCapture, lockControl, prefabs, physics, userModules, environment,
animatedImports, fileHandler, ping, THREE, GLTFExporterModule`.

**Never dynamic-import `/src/lib/x.js` from page code to reach a singleton** — once
vite HMR-timestamps the app's copy you get a SECOND module instance (empty stores,
false FAILs; this bit us twice). If a module you need isn't in `__stores`, add it to
the App.svelte debug hook as part of your change.

Read a store (and never write a store inside its own subscriber — read refs first,
then mutate):

```js
const value = await page.evaluate(() =>
  new Promise((r) => window.__stores.objectsGroup.subscribe((g) => r(g?.children.length))()));
```

## Single-page flow

- `goto(url, { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' })` (NOT networkidle — peerjs sockets never
  idle), ~4s wait, then `waitForFunction(() => window.__stores?.moduleSDK)`.
- UI anchors: bottom nav `p[title="Object list (O)"]` / `p[title="Node editor (N)"]`;
  play `i.fa-play`; object rows `#object-list p[id]`; search `#object-search`;
  modules manager via `#open-modules-manager` (drawer: `closeMenu.set(false)` first)
  or `modulesOpen.set(true)`; module cards `#module-card-<id>`; draw `#draw-toolbar`;
  dungeon `#dungeon-panel`; script editor close `#script-panel-close`.
- Programmatic scene setup: `__stores.commandsHandler.sceneCommand('/create box')`
  (geometry names are capitalized THREE types — box/sphere/Button…, NOT "cube").
- Flow graphs: set `flowNodes`/`flowEdges` locally **and broadcast** `nodecreate`/
  `edgecreate` per node/edge like the UI does — relying on the 10s nodesync heal is
  slow and rate-limited (30s) → flaky.
- Viewport clicks: `helpers.projectPoint` a REAL object/point position, then
  `mouse.click` — fixed pixel guesses miss thin/overlapping geometry (the piano
  black-key lesson). Right-click must be a real `mouse.click(x,y,{button:'right'})`.
- Context menus render `role="menuitem"`; group items CONTAIN submenu text — anchored
  regex `/^Exact label$/` + `.last()` if needed.
- Action toasts have buttons now — `getByRole('button', { name: 'Approve' })` etc.

## Two-peer flow (real replication)

Use `https://theprototype.app:5173/` — hosts-mapped to 127.0.0.1; the `.app` hostname
makes peerjs use the **public cloud** (localhost tries ws://localhost:9001 and fails).
`helpers.connect(B, A)` does: fill peer id → Connect → Approve on A → ~9s settle.
Late joiners: connect a third context AFTER mutations, assert handshake state arrived
(objects/nodes/annotations/module state/env/custom defs). Voice: launch with
`--use-fake-device-for-media-stream --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream`.

## Known flakes / traps

- First run after adding a dependency: vite re-optimizes and reloads mid-test — rerun.
  Lazy wasm (rapier) needs a throwaway prewarm page first (see physics.test.cjs).
- Phase-comparison asserts between two peers: two sequential evaluates skew ~150ms —
  tolerances ≥0.6 for fast oscillations, or compare Promise.all-sampled values.
- Overlays intercept clicks (properties drawer covers right ~320px; modals block all).
- `requestPointerLock` rejects in headless — code catches it; play mode still toggles.
- PowerShell mangles emoji AND em-dashes rewriting files; inline `node -e` quoting
  breaks in PS — write scratch `.cjs` files and run them with node.
- Suites assume a clean session per context (fresh IndexedDB/localStorage); reloading a
  page keeps them — used deliberately for persistence tests (prefabs, user modules).

## Definition of done

Feature suite green (+ any suites your UI changes touched) + `npm run build` passes +
`npx svelte-check` adds no NEW errors (baseline is legacy noise; grep the output for
your files). Two-peer verification is required for anything touching replication.
VR features: cover the extracted math/state headlessly (computeMoveOffset,
computeTeleportArc pattern) and note that on-device feel is the user's manual check.
